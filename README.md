👋 **Hi there!** I'm [Zoë](https://www.zoedavidson.ca/), a Washington, DC–based **Senior Software Engineer** focused on building accessible, performant, and user-centered web applications.

### 🌍 Work That Reaches Millions  

For the past few years, I’ve been part of the team at **IKEA’s Geomagical Labs**, where I work on the [**Kreativ**](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/home-design/) platform. I help bring interactive, photorealistic room design tools to users around the world.

Along the way, I’ve contributed to launches in over a dozen new markets — adding tens of thousands of new users — and helped coordinate translations across 50+ locales. Most of my work involves collaborating across teams and time zones to build features that scale globally and feel local.

### 🛠️ Tech I’ve Been Using Lately

### 🧑‍🏫 Beyond Code  

Before tech, I was a university professor. That passion for education continues through the [**Davidson Programming Academy**](https://www.zoedavidson.ca/)—an online bootcamp and YouTube channel where I teach aspiring front-end developers how to get started in the industry.

In my free time, I enjoy making films — a creative outlet that complements my love for coding and problem-solving.
