## 🧑‍🏫 Beyond Code  

Before tech, I was a university professor. That passion for education continues through the [**Davidson Programming Academy**](https://www.zoedavidson.ca/)—an online bootcamp and YouTube channel where I teach aspiring front-end developers how to get started in the industry.

In my free time, I enjoy making films — a creative outlet that complements my love for coding and problem-solving.
