:wave:&#127998; Hi there! I'm [ZoÃ«](https://www.zoedavidson.ca/), a Washington, DC based software engineer. 

## Projects
A personal project I'm currently working on is [Feedback](https://feedback-liart.vercel.app/). It's a fullstack app task management app, a bit like Jira or AirTable. If you'd like to checkout my code [here's a link to the repo](https://github.com/zdavidson/feedback).  

Some of my past projects include: [Audiophile](https://audiophile-seven.vercel.app/), and [PlanetHub](https://planet-hub.vercel.app/).

Most recently I've been working with: TypeScript, Next.js, GraphQL, React Query, Material UI, Supabase, and Relay to name a few...but I ***love*** learning new pieces of tech!
