**Hi there!** I'm [**Zoë**](https://www.zoedavidson.ca/), a Washington, DC–based software engineer focused on building user-centered web applications. In my spare time, I teach aspiring engineers how to code on [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidsonProgrammingAcademy).


## Projects  

A few of the projects I've worked on include:

- [**IKEA Kreativ**](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/home-design/): A photorealistic mixed-reality web platform that empowers millions of users worldwide to design and customize their living spaces in immersive, interactive ways. 
- [**Amazon Clone**](https://amazon-tutorial.vercel.app/): An e-commerce Amazon clone with dynamic cart and checkout flow.
- [**Audiophile**](https://audiophile-seven.vercel.app/): A fully responsive e-commerce site built with Next.js and TypeScript.
