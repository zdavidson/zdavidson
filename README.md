# Hi there :wave:&#127998;

I'm [ZoÃ«](https://www.zoedavidson.ca/), a Washington, DC based software engineer.

## Projects
A personal project I'm currently working on is [Feedback](https://feedback-liart.vercel.app/). It's a fullstack app task management app, a bit like Jira or AirTable. If you'd like to checkout my code [here's a link to the repo](https://github.com/zdavidson/feedback).  

A couple of past projects include: [Audiophile](https://audiophile-seven.vercel.app/), and [PlanetHub](https://planet-hub.vercel.app/).

## Tech
Most recently I've been working with:
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- GraphQL
- React Query
- Material UI
- Supabase
- Relay

...but I ***love*** learning new tech!
